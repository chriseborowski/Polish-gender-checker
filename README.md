# polish-gender-checker
Gender checker for Polish-language words.

This is a program that checks the grammatical gender of the input noun in Polish.
As the development progresses, new updates will include more complicated functions
allowing users to detect the gender of the word more effectively, including exception.

This version of the program works for nouns in the following categories:
(a) masculine singular,
(b) feminine singular,
(c) neuter singular,
(d) masculine (virile) singular,
(e) nonmasculine (virile) singular,
